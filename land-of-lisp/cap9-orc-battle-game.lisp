  -- ORC BATTLE GAME --

In the Orc Battle game, you are a knight surrounded by 12 monsters, engaged
in a fight to the death. With your superior wits and your repertoire
of sword-fighting maneuvers, you must carefully make strategies in your battle with orcs,
hydras, and other nasty enemies.

Using DEFMETHOD and DEFSTRUCT, let's dispatch some whoop ass on these vermin!
